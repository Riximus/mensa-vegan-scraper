# Description
This is a python script that scrapes the content from a restaurant to filter out the vegan options. <br>

If there are vegan options the message will have the name of the menus and the description of it. <br>
After checking the contents it will send a Windows Notification with the corresponded content.

# Setting up 'Task Scheduler'

Thanks to GeeksForGeeks Task Scheduler Tutorial I could set up a daily notification for the script.
